-Buttons that move away from the mouse
DONE

-Text fields that scramble what you enter


-Radio buttons that select a button other than the one you picked.


-Forms that rearrange themselves or colors change when you fill in a field.
(I know you’ll have fun doing that)

Then try some stuff with CSS, like web pages where the content scrolls over 
a static background (lots of companies have pages like that). It’s called Parallax Scrolling. 
There’s even a W3Schools How-To on it.
DONE


Another thing to do is explore Google’s web developer site which has lots of best-practices for web page design and examples of development patterns - https://web.dev/.

maybe I do a page with each skill and then do like a mode where I explain how to do it for others!!!
