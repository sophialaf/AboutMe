        <h1>BUT WE PERSERVERED!!!!!!</h1>
        <p>Full honesty: none of these pictures were because of coding.</p>
        <p>I <i>believe</i> these were, in order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Grey's Anatomy (Meredith nearly died)</li><br>
            <li>Grey's Anatomy (An amish girl has to shun her best friend so she can die with her Amish family)</li><br>
            <li>Twilight (Bella was preparing for her daughter and Jacob to live on if she died)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of crying. I try to every day. If it doesn't happen naturally, I like to watch soldiers coming home videos</p>
