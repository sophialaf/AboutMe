        <h1> What is Bananagrams?</h1>
        <h2>Imagine scrabble but freeform and more chaotic.</h2>
        <h3>
            The objective of the game is to be the first person to use all the
            <br> tiles you're given to create one big contiguous scrabble board.
        </h3>
        <h3> There are a couple different mechanics in the game play:</h3>
        <div style="text-align:left;margin-left: 140px;">
        <ol>
            <li><b>Peel</b></li>
            <p>Peel is what you call when you use all the letter tiles in your hand.</p>
            <p>It will give all players in the game another tile.</p>
            <p>You can only peel when all of your tiles are connected to one gameboard</p>
            <p>and all words are valid in the dictionary.</p>
            <li><b>Dump</b></li>
            <p>Dumping a tile is a choice players have to swap out one tiles in their</p>
            <p>hand for 3 more random ones from the remaining tiles.</p>
            <p>This does not affect the other players directly; only that it takes</p>
            <p>tiles from the shared source.</p>
            <li><b>Bananas</b></li>
            <p>Bananas is called when you think you've won!</p>
            <p>Your board will then be checked to see if all words are valid and connected.</p>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <h3>You can rearrange your tiles as much as you want and _____</h3>
        <h2>The MOST important rule is to as much fun as humanly possible. </h2>
        <h1>Go bananas.</h1>
