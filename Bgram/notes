the game id binds the players to a game that talks to a server. server gets a message from a player 
(like peel) then server tells everyone innthe game its tome to peel
sets game state like the version thing and creates like a peel change
old versions would then get a tile

Maybe there's a check on how many tiles are remaining and if there aren't anymore 
then the split option goes dark. You can only then check for Bananas

should there be a timer? and maybe a scoreboard for shortest time?
